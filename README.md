# Kristian Emil

At the crossroads of animation and code, I craft digital experiences that move. I use motion to give interfaces a heartbeat, making every interaction feel natural, personal, and alive.

With a background in motion design and a design-first approach to Swift development, I create expressive, intuitive interfaces that blend art and engineering. My goal is to turn ideas into apps that not only work beautifully but feel alive in the user’s hands.

Currently working with Swift 6 and its Concurrency features, I focus on building high-performance, visually distinctive applications that stand out in the App Store.
