## Professional Profile
Passionate iOS developer with a unique background in motion design, creating experiences users can feel. My ambition is to transform apps into visually captivating journeys that stand out in the App Store.

I combine SwiftUI with careful attention to animations and user interactions. My background as both creative and operations manager enables me to connect technical development with creative solutions.

Currently working with Swift 6.0 and its Concurrency features, which I see as central to developing secure, high-performance apps. My goal is to create impactful applications where unique design, animation, and technical expertise work together to engage and enrich the user experience.

This allows me to demonstrate my capabilities while your organization can evaluate my contributions without financial burden. I am highly motivated, adapt quickly to new work environments, and always approach work with a smile.
