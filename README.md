###### Design Engineer

At the crossroads of animation and code, I craft digital experiences that move. I use motion to give interfaces a heartbeat, making every interaction feel natural, personal, and alive.

With a background in motion design and a design-first approach to Swift development, I create expressive, intuitive interfaces that blend art and engineering. My goal is to turn ideas into apps that not only work beautifully but feel alive in the user’s hands.
